        "### The Sales Process\n",
        "\n",
        "An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Individuals land on the website, they might browse the courses, watch some videos and if they are interested they will fill up a form for the course.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Once individuals fill out a form, they have now become a potential customer or **lead**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Employees from the sales team will contact leads by emailing or calling them with the goal of getting the lead to sign up for the course - called a **conversion**\n",

        "\n",
        "- Currently only 38% of leads contacted go on to become a paying customer.\n",
        "- The CEO wants to grow the customer base by 20% over the next year\n",
        "\n",
        "### Complication\n",
        "\n",
        "- The head of the sales & advertising department has marketing budget to increase advertising and generate 20% more leads, but does not have the headcount to contact every lead already, so more leads would not necessarily mean more conversions\n",
        "- The department head knows that a conversion rate of 38% means a lot of time and money is wasted on customers who never intended to sign up.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Question\n",
        "\n",
        "- How can data science help to convert more leads with the same or less amount of calls?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Answer\n",
        "\n",
        "- A lead scoring model trained on historical conversion data could help us to prioritise leads and form a better queue to call from 'hottest' lead to 'coldest'\n",
        "\n",
        "Your idea for a lead scoring model gets approved - now you need to look at the data you and decide what model you are going to build!"
